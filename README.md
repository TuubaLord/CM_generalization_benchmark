# CM_generalization_benchmark
A benchmarking tool for the generalization of different intelligent fault diagnosis methods


## Purpose
Scientific studies on intelligent fault diagnosis don't have a universial benchmark to demonstrate their generalization capabilities. This tool aggregates different datasets and has a variety of test scenarios using these datasets to validate how a model generalizes in different scenarios. The benchmark will give the model a ranking based on generalization and the type of problem solved

### Generalization scores


### Types of problems
- Fault diagnosis
- Anomaly detection



### Used datasets
- Aalto gear fault dataset (AGFD)
- Aalto shim dataset (ASD)
- Case-Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing fault dataset
- NLN-EMP pump dataset
